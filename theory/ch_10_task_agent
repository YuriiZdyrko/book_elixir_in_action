Tasks can work in 2 modes:
- awaited
(Task.async/await)

- non-awaited
Task.start_link


Non-awasks are useful for communication with external services, like
metrics collection/sending, or one-off jobs.
For cron jobs, use Quantum library.



Agent = Genserver with only [init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2] callbacks
{:ok, pid} = Agent.start_link(fn -> init_state end, name: ...)
Agent.cast(agent_pid, fn state -> new_state end)
Agent.get(agent_pid, fn state -> response end)

TLDR: NEVER USE AGENT. JUST USE GEN_SERVER!
