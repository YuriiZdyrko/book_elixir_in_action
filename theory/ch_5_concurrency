Server process - runs indefinitely, has state.
Interface functions - public, executed in caller process.
Implementation functions - private, executed in server process.

Functional programming - always keep value in a variable
Concurrent programming - always keep pid in a variable

A server process does:
¡ Spawn a separate process
¡ Run an infinite loop in the process
¡ Maintain the process state
¡ React to messages
¡ Send a response back to the caller

List all (including macro-generated) functions
MyModule.__info__(:functions)

[child_spec: 1, code_change: 3, handle_call: 3, handle_cast: 2,
handle_info: 2, init: 1, terminate: 2]

@impl GenServer
def handle_call

Using @impl allows compile-time checking of arguments. 
Use @impl if behaviour is used!
